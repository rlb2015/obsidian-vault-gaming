[Viking ships - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_ships)

Longships were naval vessels made and used by the Vikings from Scandinavia and Iceland for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during the [Viking Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age"). The longship's design evolved over many years, as seen in the Nydam and [Kvalsund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvalsund_ship "Kvalsund ship") ships. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boatbuilding traditions until today. The average speed of Viking ships varied from ship to ship but lay in the range of 5 to 10 knots (9 to 19 km/h), and the maximum speed of a longship under favorable conditions was around 15 knots (28 km/h).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_ships#cite_note-7)

The long-ship is as a graceful, long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed. The ship's shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one meter deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over [portages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage "Portage"). Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around. Longships were fitted with oars along almost the entire length of the boat itself. Later versions sported a rectangular sail on a single mast which was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers, particularly during long journeys.

Longships can be classified into a number of different types, depending on size, construction details, and prestige. The most common way to classify longships is by the number of rowing positions on board. Types ranged from the Karvi, with 13 rowing benches, to the Busse, one of which has been found with an estimated 34 rowing positions.

Longships were the epitome of Scandinavian naval power at the time and were highly valued possessions. They were owned by coastal farmers and assembled by the king to form the leidang in times of conflict, in order to have a powerful naval force at his disposal. While longships were deployed by the Norse in warfare, there are no descriptions of naval tactics such as ramming, etc. Instead, the ships would sometimes be lashed together in battle to form a steady platform for infantry warfare. Longships were called dragonships (_drakuskippan_) by the [Franks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franks "Franks") because they had a dragon-shaped [prow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prow "Prow").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_ships#cite_note-8)
