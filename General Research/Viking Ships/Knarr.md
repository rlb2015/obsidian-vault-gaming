Knarr is the Norse term for ships that were built for cargo transport. A length of about 54 feet (16 m) and a beam of 15 feet (4.6 m) are not untypical, and the hull could be capable of carrying up to 24 tons.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_ships#cite_note-4) Overall displacement: 50 tons. This is shorter than the Gokstad type of longships, but knarrs are sturdier by design and they depended mostly on sail-power, only putting oars to use as auxiliaries if there was no wind on the open water. Because of this, the knarr was used for longer voyages, ocean-going transports and more hazardous trips than the Gokstad type. It was capable of sailing 75 miles (121 km) in one day, and held a crew of about 20–30. Knarrs[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_ships#cite_note-5) routinely crossed the [North Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic "North Atlantic") in the Viking Age, carrying livestock and goods to and from [Greenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland "Greenland") and the North Atlantic islands. The design of the knarr later influenced the design of the [cog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cog_(ship) "Cog (ship)"), used in the [Baltic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea "Baltic Sea") by the [Hanseatic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League "Hanseatic League"). Examples of [Viking Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age") [knarr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knarr "Knarr") are [Skuldelev 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skuldelev_ships#Skuldelev_1 "Skuldelev ships"), which was excavated in Denmark in 1962 and is believed to be from about 1030 AD, and the [Äskekärr ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C3%84skek%C3%A4rr_ship&action=edit&redlink=1 "Äskekärr ship (page does not exist)") [[sv](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84skek%C3%A4rrskeppet "sv:Äskekärrskeppet")], which was found in Sweden in 1933 and is believed to be from about 930 AD.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_ships#cite_note-6)

_Knarr_ is the Old Norse term for a type of ship built for long sea voyages and used during the [Viking expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_expansion "Viking expansion"). The knarr was a cargo ship; the hull was wider, deeper and shorter than a longship, and could take more cargo and be operated by smaller crews. They were built with a length of about 16 m (54 ft), a beam of 5 m (15 ft), and a hull capable of carrying up to 24 tons.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knarr#cite_note-2) It was primarily used to transport trading goods like walrus [ivory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_trade "Ivory trade"), wool, timber, wheat, furs and pelts, armour, slaves, honey, and weapons. It was also used to supply food, drink, weapons and armour to warriors and traders along their journeys across the Baltic, the Mediterranean and other seas. Knarrs routinely crossed the North Atlantic carrying livestock such as sheep and horses, and stores to Norse settlements in [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland "Iceland"), [Greenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland "Greenland") and [Vinland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinland "Vinland") as well as trading goods to trading posts in the British Isles, Continental Europe and possibly the Middle East. They may have been used in colonising, although a similar small cargo vessel (the _byrthing_) is another possibility.
