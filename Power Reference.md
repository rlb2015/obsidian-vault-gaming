## Shorting

A character may cast a power with fewer Power Points than it requires (whether she has them or not) by increasing the difficulty of her arcane skill roll. For every Power Point a character will short, she suffers a −1 penalty to the roll. Casting a 3-point healing with 0 Power Points, for example, inflicts a −3 penalty. Shorting is risky. If a character fails a shorted arcane skill roll, it’s consid- ered a Critical Failure!

## Power Modifiers

### Armor Piercing (+1 to +3)
The attack is focused to defeat armor or seeks out a foe’s exposed areas. Each Power Point spent grants the power AP 2 (see page 65), to a maximum of AP 6.

### Fatigue (+2)
Powers that drain or tax an opponent can cause Fatigue. This modifier may be attached to any power that can cause damage or is resisted by the target. If she’s affected by the power in any way, she also suffers Fatigue. This cannot cause Incapacitation, however.

### Glow/Shroud (+1)
Glow gives off soft light of an appro- priate color for its Trapping (or caster’s choice). This creates soft light in a Small Blast Template centered on the target, and lasts until the power expires. It subtracts 2 from her Stealth totals and negates 1 point of Illumination penalties for those attacking the glowing character. Shroud dims and slightly obscures the target so that attacks against her suffer a −1 penalty and she adds +1 to her Stealth rolls.

### Heavy Weapon (+2)
The caster pours his energy into the attack, creating a focused blast. The attack counts as a Heavy Weapon.

### Hinder/Hurry (+1)
The target is slowed in some way, perhaps due to intense cold, a slippery surface, or even binding matter or energy. His base Pace is reduced by 2 until the power expires. A caster can Hurry the recipient instead. He might get increased energy, sure footing, or more powerful muscles. His Pace is increased by 2.  Effects of either modifier aren’t cumulative.

### Lingering Damage (+2)
The target is hit by fire, intense cold, acid, gnawing insects, or some other Trapping that continues to cause damage after the initial attack. On the victim’s next turn, he suffers the power’s base damage minus one die type (one additional turn only). If hit with a 2d6 bolt, for example, the victim takes 2d4 damage at the start of his next turn. If the base damage is already a d4 die type, it loses a die instead.

### Range (+1/+2)
Double the power’s listed Range for 1 Power Point, or triple it for +2. This modifier may not be used on powers with a Range of Touch or the Cone Template.
### Selective (+1)
With intense focus, the caster can choose not to affect any or all individual targets within a power’s area of effect (picking all enemies instead of allies in a blast, for example).

## Cantrips

In Pathfinder for Savage Worlds, any character with an Arcane Background can cast cantrips

### ACTIVATION
A character may cast a cantrip by making an arcane skill roll. This is an action, and the effect must be based on one of the character’s existing powers. A sorcerer could use bolt with a fire Trapping to light a campfire, for example. A druid could use entangle to make vines dance to entertain a group of children. A wizard can use sound to ring a bell calling a servant to his study.

Success means the desired effect occurs. A raise has an additional narrative impact of some kind—the candle glows brightly, the vines dance in perfect synchronicity, or the bell rings loud and pure.

Failure causes the spell to fail without effect. A Critical Failure causes the spell to backfire, which requires the caster to lose 1 Power Point (or suffer Fatigue if the caster has no Power Points). Critical Failure also causes an embarrassment or minor mishap of some sort—an animated broom carelessly knocks a jar of ink onto the floor, a conjured flame lights a book on fire, or the power makes an embarrassing sound or smell.

A successfully cast cantrip’s Duration is the same as the power it’s based on and may be maintained by spending Power Points as usual.

The GM has the final say on what a cantrip can do, but the effect must not replace a power or cause damage (at least directly). It can be used to Test or Support, or grant a +1 bonus on a subsequent roll in the same encounter. For example, if the bard uses a cantrip to impress the children of Sandpoint, the GM might give him +1 to a Persuasion roll later on if he talks to their parents or someone else who witnessed the kindness.
