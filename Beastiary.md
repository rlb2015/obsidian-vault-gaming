# Troll, Feral

Trolls are large humanoids with greenish hide, sharp claws, and bestial faces. Their stooped posture belies their size-14 feet tall and 1,000 pounds — but doesn’t diminish their formidable presence. Trolls regenerate quickly, unless the damage inflicted is fire or acid-based. They deliver powerful blows with their claws, though they are also capable of fighting with weapons. The creatures dwell in the wild areas of the Inner Sea region, most commonly in northern Avistan. In most troll societies, the males are solitary hunters and wanders, while the females and children live in extended family groups. Type: Evil Humanoid (Troll)

-   **Fast Regeneration:** Trolls may attempt a natural healing roll every round, even if Incapacitated, unless their Wounds were caused by fire or acid or they're put to the torch afterward.
-   **Rending:** Victims Shaken or Wounded by a rending attack are bleeding and must make a Vigor roll as a free action at the beginning of their next turn. Failure causes one Wound and the victim must make another Vigor roll next turn. Success means the victim doesn't suffer a Wound, but must make a Vigor roll again next turn. A raise stops the bleeding and no further rolls are required from that attack. A successful Healing roll also stops the bleeding.
-   **Very Resilient:** Trolls can take two Wounds before they're Incapacitated.
-   **Languages:** Giant.
