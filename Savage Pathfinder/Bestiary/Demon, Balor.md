**Description**
A balor is a towering figure of fire and flesh-a horned, flying nightmare armed with flaming whip and a mighty sword. On the Abyss, most balors serve demon lords as general or captains. Some balors are even demon lords and masters themselves. A balor typically commands vast legions of demons. It often lets these slavering minions fight its battles, although most balors join a fight whenever an opportunity presents itself. Type: Evil Outsider (Balor)
