**Description**
Ferocious and bestial in form, the glabrezu is a master of trickery and lies. These treacherous demons form from the souls of the treasonous, the false, and the subversive. That is, souls of mortals who, in life, bore false witness or used treachery and deceit to ruin the lives of others. With its ability to cloak its true form in pleasant illusions, the glabrezu uses its magic to grant wishes to mortal humanoids as a method of rewarding those who succumb to its guile and deceit. A wish granted by a glabrezu always fulfills the wisher’s need in the most destructive way possible- although such methods might not be immediately apparent. Type: Evil Outsider (Glabrezu)
