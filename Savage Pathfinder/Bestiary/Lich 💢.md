Few creatures on Golarion are more feared than the lich. The pinnacle of necromantic art, the lich is a spellcaster who has chosen to shed his or her life as a method to cheat death by becoming undead. While many who reach such heights of power stop at nothing to achieve immortality, the very idea of becoming a lich is abhorrent to most creatures.
