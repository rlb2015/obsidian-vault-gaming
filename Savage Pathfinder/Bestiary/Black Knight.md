Clad in jet-black plate armor and armed with terrible weapons glowing with balefire, black knights are the elite troops of the demon lords. Beneath their armor is a mummified corpse with burning green eyes and a miasma of pain and hatred. Black knights most often serve as unit commanders in demonic armies, but can sometimes be found as bodyguards for powerful evil wizards and priests. Many ride nightmares as well (see page 186).
