**Description**
Profane champions of the Abyss, vrocks embody all the rage, hatred, and violence of that despicable realm. As ravenous and grotesquely opportunistic as the avian scavengers they resemble, vrocks delight in bloodshed, relishing the sounds and sensations of ripping the still-pulsing entrails from a living husk. Vrocks usually form from the evil souls of hateful and wrathful mortals, particularly criminals, mercenaries, or assassins. Type: Evil Outsider (Vrock) Languages: Abyssal, Celestrial, Draconic.
