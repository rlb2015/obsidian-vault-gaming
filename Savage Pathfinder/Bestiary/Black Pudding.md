Somewhat common on Golarion, these dreaded oozes inhabit caves and tunnels from Varisia to the Darklands. They scavenge for organic material, consuming all manner of refuse but also attacking creatures - especially creatures that possess metallic substances. Black pudding can reproduce by breaking off pieces of themselves, which grow over a month’s time into a full-sized creature. They appear as dark, amorphous blobs but can alter their shape to fit into tight spaces, and to attack with their ability to envelop an opponent. Type: Neutral Ooze (Black Pudding)
