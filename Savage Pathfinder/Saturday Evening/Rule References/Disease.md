Diseases cover a wide range of maladies, from long-term debilitating illnesses to those which might cause immediate spasms or death. 

Diseases can be contracted through various vectors, such as an airborne source, ingestion, or the touch or bite of a creature that causes a Wound or Shaken result. In any of these situations, the victim must make an immediate Vigor roll to avoid infection. 

To handle such a diverse range of diseases, we’ve broken them down into three major categories. If you’re trying to model a specific disease, adjust the rules presented here to better reflect its symptoms. 

**Recovery**: Diseases can be cured by the healing power with the Neutralize Poison or Disease modifier, or with specific medications — whether or not those are available depends on the game (GM’s call). The symptoms can often be treated by common medicines, however. With a successful Healing roll, a physician, priest, herbalist, etc., can prescribe or create a treatment. She may attempt to do so once per day

## DISEASE CATEGORIES

| Type | Effect |
| ----- | ------ |
| Chronic | At the start of every game session, the character makes a Vigor roll. Failure means he’s Exhausted from spasms, coughing fits, or similar issues for that session. A Critical Failure means he will expire before the end of the session. The GM is encouraged to let heroes go out in a blaze of glory if possible. Success means the victim is Fatigued for the game session, and a raise means he gets a second wind and suffers no ill effects.|
| Debilitating | Flus, viruses, stomach bugs and the like have various specific symptoms but generally result in the character being Fatigued for 2d6 days.|
| Lethal | Fast-acting diseases might be found in the darkest depths of forgotten dungeons or in specific locations on Golarion. Upon contracting the disease, the hero is Fatigued. At the start of each turn thereafter, he must make a Vigor roll or suffer a Wound! (Some diseases may call for a Vigor roll more slowly, such as once per hour or once per day.) A successful Healing roll stops the effects only if the proper medicine is on hand to stop the disease|
