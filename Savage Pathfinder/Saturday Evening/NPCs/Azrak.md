Seasoned Male Half-Elf

**Background**
Azrak is a half-elf, who growing up felt disconnected from both his ancestries.   He started seeing the so called evil peoples from a different perspective.   Eventually, he settled on the view that Ogres were the natural successors to ruling the earth.   

He started helping them, and enlightening them to their power, organizing them.  Preparing them to seize control of the land and maybe the world.
