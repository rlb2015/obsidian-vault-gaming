## Status Updates
### [[Amaris]] 
- Chronic Disease
	- ** Effect** - At the start of every game session, the character makes a Vigor roll. Failure means heâ€™s Exhausted from spasms, coughing fits, or similar issues for that session. A Critical Failure means he will expire before the end of the session. The GM is encouraged to let heroes go out in a blaze of glory if possible. Success means the victim is Fatigued for the game session, and a raise means he gets a second wind and suffers no ill effects.
	- **Recovery** - Diseases can be cured by the healing power with the Neutralize Poison or Disease modifier, or with specific medications â€” whether or not those are available depends on the game (GMâ€™s call). The symptoms can often be treated by common medicines, however. With a successful Healing roll, a physician, priest, herbalist, etc., can prescribe or create a treatment. She may attempt to do so once per day
