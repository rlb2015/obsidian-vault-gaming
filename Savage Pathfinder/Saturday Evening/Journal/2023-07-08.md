## Encounters

### Act 1 - Travel Back to Halgrim

There is a ship in port in [[Hegranes]] that is headed to Halgrim, a typical [[Knarr]] with a full load, piloted by Hann Borstad.   They are short 10 men so have some room for passengers when they generally wouldn't.  The cost is 35 sp (5 sp/day, and they travel 75 miles per day.  At ~500 miles to Halgrim, that's 7 days travel).  The crew keep a watch every night and promise that they will wake the PC if anything is amiss.

On the evening of the 3rd day, if non of the PCs are on watch, they will wake to a gurgling scream as all but the captain and 2 rew members are killed by a figure in a cloak.   The figure will dive overboard in the dark, they will see him treading water, ignoring them. as the ship moves on leaving him alone in the ocean.

If the PCs remain on watch the assassin will instead incant a spell enveloping the ship in magical darkness, and then will proceed to kill each crew member.   The party will need to pilot the ship to port.

**Dramatic Task**: 24 tokens in 4 rounds.
